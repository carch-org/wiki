**Prerequisite:** `fzf` is required for the TUI interface in the Carch scripts. Make sure it‚Äôs installed before using Carch.

## How to use?

You can run or use Carch directly without installing it on your system.

Choose one of the following version to try Carch:

### ‚≠ê Stable Version 

```sh
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://chalisehari.com.np/carch)"
```
### üß™ Dev Version

```sh 
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://chalisehari.com.np/carchdev)"
```

## Install Script

You can install Carch permanently on your system using our install script:

```sh
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://chalisehari.com.np/carchinstall)"
```

You can also use these options:

### Update
```sh
# Update existing installation
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://chalisehari.com.np/carchinstall)" -- --update
```

### Uninstall

```sh
# Uninstall Carch
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://chalisehari.com.np/carchinstall)" -- --uninstall
```

## üì¶ Cargo Crate

Carch is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/).

You can install it using Cargo with the [carch](https://crates.io/crates/carch) crate.

```sh
cargo install carch
```

Once that's done, you can run it by typing `carch` in your terminal.

:::tip[Tip]
If `carch` isn‚Äôt recognized, add Cargo's bin directory to your PATH:

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```

### Arch Linux

```sh
sudo pacman -S --noconfirm rust man-db man git wget noto-fonts-emoji curl bash-completion ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd cargo fzf glibc gcc
```

### Fedora Linux

```sh
sudo dnf install rust man-db man git wget google-noto-color-emoji-fonts google-noto-emoji-fonts jetbrains-mono-fonts-all bash-completion-devel curl cargo fzf glibc gcc -y
```

## üîß Clone and Build

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/harilvfs/carch
cd carch
cargo build --release
cd build/release/
sudo cp -r carch /usr/local/bin/ 
```

Now you can run `carch` in your terminal. If you encounter any issues on Fedora, they might be dependency-related. The installation should work smoothly, but if any problems arise, please open an [issue](https://github.com/harilvfs/carch/issues) or email me at **harilvfs@chalisehari.com.np**.
