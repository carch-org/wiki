*I have a good habit of exploring new things and trying out different ideas, whether itâ€™s scripting or Linux-related tasks. Often, I find myself diving into scripting projects or experimenting with tools, even if it starts with just sitting around and tinkering.*

One of my inspirations has been watching Chris Titus Tech's [live streams](https://www.youtube.com/@TitusTechTalk) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@ChrisTitusTech). Chris has been working on an amazing project called [`linutil`](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/linutil/). It gave me the idea to start building my own project, but in my own unique way. Initially, my project was quite basicâ€”just a script with a `whiptail`-based TUI. It felt somewhat boring and clunky at the time.

Later, I discovered another inspiring creator, ML4W (My Linux For Work), whose [Hyprland scripts and configurations](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles) are quite popular. After exploring their repository, I noticed they used tools like `gum` and `figlet` in their scripts. I was amazed to see how these tools added flair to bash scripting.

Inspired by this, I returned to my own scripting work and implemented `gum` and `figlet` for enhanced ASCII text and user interactivity. It wasnâ€™t an instant successâ€”the development process took time and effortâ€”but day by day, my script became more polished. Now, Iâ€™m quite proud of what Iâ€™ve built, and I truly enjoy using these tools in my work.

**I want to thank both [Chris Titus Tech](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech) and [ML4W](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/) for being such incredible sources of ideas and inspiration. While I put in the work, their creativity and contributions to the Linux community have played a big role in shaping my own journey. ðŸ˜Š**
