## Contributing to **Carch** 

We're excited that you're interested in contributing to **Carch**! Contributions of all kinds are welcome, whether you're fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving documentation. Follow this guide to get started.

:::note[Note] 
> **Before making any contributions**, first open an issue in the **[Feature Request](https://github.com/harilvfs/carch/issues/new?template=feature-reqests.yml)** section. We will discuss the changes there before proceeding with implementation. 
:::

## 📌 Understand the Codebase

:::tip[Tip]
> Before contributing, **understand the structure** of Carch:
> - **The `main` Rust files of Carch are located in:** `src`
>
>```sh
> src/
> ├── ui/
> │   ├── app.rs
> │   ├── mod.rs
> │   ├── popups.rs
> │   └── render.rs 
> ├── main.rs 
> ├── commands.rs
> ├── display.rs
> ├── script_list.rs 
> └── version.rs
> ```
> 
> - **All `modules` scripts are organized by category in:**  
> ```sh
> modules/
> ├── Browser/     # Browser related scripts 
> ├── Desktop/     # Desktop environment related scripts
> ├── Development/ # Development tools scripts
> ├── System/      # System configuration scripts
> └── Terminal/    # Terminal setup scripts
> ```

:::

:::note[Note]
> First, **analyze how the script works** before making any changes. If you want to improve or add to the project, make sure you **understand the structure** and how each piece interacts. This will help you contribute in a way that is consistent with the project's design. 
>
> ```sh
> For committing, use labels like
> feat: your-commit-message or fix: your-commit-message.
> ```
>
> Btw, before committing, if you are changing any `.sh` or bash script file, make sure to check the `scripts/` directory and run `./check.sh` for any extra white or blank spaces. If it fails, run `./cleanup.sh`. That is only for bash scripts.  
> For Rust file changes, make sure to run `cargo fmt --all --check`. If there are any suggestions, run `cargo fmt --all`.  
> Also, make sure to run `cargo clippy` and `cargo clippy -- -Dwarnings` to ensure there are no errors left. Thanks.

## 📚 Contributing to Carch Docs

#### **Carch Docs** is ➥ [Live Here](https://github.com/carch-org/docs)  

### 🚀 Ways to Contribute

You can contribute by:

- 🪛 Fixing typos or mistakes in existing guides  
- 🌐 Translating the documentation into other languages (**highly encouraged!**)  

### 🌍 Translating Documentation

#### Want to help make Carch accessible to users worldwide? Help us translate the docs!

If you're contributing a **new language**, follow these steps:

1. 📁 Create a new folder for your language inside the `docs/` directory. Use [ISO 639-1 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) (e.g. `fr`, `es`, `hi`, etc.).  
2. 🛠️ Translate the Markdown content inside the new folder.  
3. 🧩 Modify `docs/.vitepress/config.ts`:  
   - Add your language in the `locales` section.  
   - Provide a `label`, `lang`, and `link` for navigation.  

### 🧪 Testing Your Changes Locally

To preview your changes:

```sh
bun install
bun run docs:dev
```

:::note[Note]
> Please open an issue first if you plan to introduce major structural or organizational changes. We’d love to discuss and collaborate on it beforehand!
:::

### 🧾 Commit Style

Use clear commit messages like:

```sh
git commit -m "fix(docs): correct typo in installation guide"
git commit -m "feat(docs): add Hindi translation"
```
