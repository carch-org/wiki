:::caution[Caution]
> I do not guarantee that Carch will work on Arch-based* or Fedora-based* distros. Use it on such distros at your own risk, as I do not officially support them.
> 
> However, Carch will work fine on the mainline distributions, like Arch Linux and Fedora.
:::

**To install Carch, execute the following command in your terminal:**


:::note[Note]
> **Make sure to install `curl` before running this command:** **`sudo pacman -S curl`** or **`sudo dnf install curl -y`**  
>
> **Also, check the `make` and `less` packages (for Arch only).**

## Manual Installation

<br>

#### Dependencies

<Tabs syncKey="pkg">
<TabItem label="Arch">

```sh
sudo pacman -S rust gum figlet man-db man git wget unzip noto-fonts-emoji ttf-joypixels curl tree-sitter tree-sitter-bash gcc-libs glibc bash bash-completion ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols ttf-jetbrains-mono ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd bat zsh fish

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Fedora">

```sh
sudo dnf install rust gum figlet man-db man git wget unzip google-noto-color-emoji-fonts google-noto-emoji-fonts bat jetbrains-mono-fonts-all bash-completion-devel zsh fish rust-tree-sitter-devel glibc curl gcc
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Clone and Build

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/harilvfs/carch
cd carch
cargo build --release
cd target/release/
sudo cp -r carch /usr/bin/ 
```

Now you can run `carch` in your terminal. If you encounter any issues on Fedora, they might be dependency-related. It should work fine, but if any problems arise, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/harilvfs/carch/issues) or email me at **harilvfs@chalisehari.com.np**.
