# Inspiration

- **[ChrisTitusTech `linutil`](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/linutil/)**  

I love messing around with Linux and scripts. Most of the time, Iâ€™m just experimenting, trying random ideas for fun. Even if Iâ€™m just sitting and bored, I somehow end up building weird little tools.

One of the things that really inspired me was watching [Chris Titus Tech](https://www.youtube.com/@ChrisTitusTech) and his [streams](https://www.youtube.com/@TitusTechTalk). Heâ€™s working on a cool project called [`linutil`](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/linutil/), and that kinda gave me the push to make my own version of something like itâ€”but in my own messy way.

In the beginning, the project was... well, **ugly**. I used `whiptail` for the menu. It worked, but it looked super old-school and felt kinda clunky. Honestly, it was just a basic shell script with a bunch of menus slapped together.

Later on, I started using `gum`, which I found through [ml4w](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork). It made things look a lot nicer. But then I tried out `fzf`, and that just clicked. It was way faster and cleaner for what I wanted to do. So I ditched `gum` (still love it tho ðŸ’–) and went all-in on `fzf`.

ðŸ¦€ And now... big step: Iâ€™ve added a full Rust-based TUI using `ratatui`. No more ugly menus. The new interface looks way better, runs smoother, and I can finally add features that just werenâ€™t possible in Bash alone.

**Just to be clear thoughâ€”the actual Carch scripts (like setup scripts, tools, etc.) are still written in Bash.** Iâ€™m not rewriting all of that in Rust (that would be insane). The Rust TUI is mainly for the menu systemâ€”handling navigation, categories, and preview. When you select something, it still runs the Bash scripts underneath, and yep, `fzf` is still doing the job there too!

So yeah, itâ€™s a mix: Rust for the interface, Bash for the logic, and `fzf` in the middle holding it all together. Itâ€™s weirdâ€”but it works!

Carch really came a long wayâ€”from something super basic and kinda ugly, to something Iâ€™m proud of. Still lots to do, but itâ€™s getting cooler every day.
