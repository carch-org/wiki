:::caution[Caution]
> I do not guarantee that Carch will work on Arch-based* or Fedora-based* distros. Use it on such distros at your own risk, as I do not officially support them.
> 
> However, Carch will work fine on the mainline distributions, like Arch Linux and Fedora.
:::

**To install Carch, execute the following command in your terminal:**


:::note[Note]
> **Make sure to install `curl` before running this command:** **`sudo pacman -S curl`** or **`sudo dnf install curl -y`**  
>
> **Also, check the `make` and `less` packages (for Arch only).**
